# SkimLit

The objective of this project was to build a NLP model to classify abstract sentences into the role they play (e.g. objective, methods, results, etc) to enable researchers to skim through the literature.

The dataset used is taken from this paper, https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071 .

The final model which acheived 86% accuracy is based on the model presented in this paper, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05251.pdf .
